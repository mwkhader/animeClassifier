# animeClassifier

This project is largely a copy of an online tutorial for a CNN classifier adapted for the specific problem.
The problem involved is identifying an animated image as either an anime or cartoon.
The main question being addressed is whether "Avatar: The Last Airbender" is an anime.

The dataset used is scraped from the web to get ~500 images of cartoons and anime each.
